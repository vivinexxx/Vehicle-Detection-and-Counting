# Vehicle Detection and Counting

## Description
This project implements a system to detect and count vehicles in video footage using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. It can be used for traffic monitoring, vehicle density analysis, and intelligent transportation systems.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection and counting.
- Supports video uploads or live camera feeds.
- High accuracy using the YOLOv8 model.
- Easy-to-use interface for visualization.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivinexxx/Vehicle-Detection-and-Counting.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd vehicle-detection-and-counting
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Download the YOLOv8 Model**:
   - Visit the [YOLO official website](https://ultralytics.com/yolov8) to download the pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
   - Place the model file in the `models` folder.

## Usage
1. **Upload Video**:
   - Add your video file to the `input_videos` directory.
2. **Run the Detection Script**:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --video input_videos/sample_video.mp4
   ```
3. **View Results**:
   - The processed video with vehicle detection and counting will be saved in the `output_videos` directory.

## Dataset
You can use your own dataset or download public datasets from the [YOLO Dataset Repository](https://ultralytics.com/datasets). Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted before use.
